OS Experiment Code

OSE 1

Briefly, it just some simple code I made for one of the Operating System course's experiment.

In it I tried to visualize 2 dispatch method for dispatching PCBs.

And I made all these in less than 8 hours, and I think I wrap it around bad.

Anyway it is built on the SpriteKit Framework & all in all I think it is useful, at making small project or 装逼.

Maybe it isn't that user-friendly enough to let everyone see how it visualizes the process.

This is about the Banker's Algorithm for preventing deadlocks, when a process request some resources from available resources to do its job.
